# Electric Vehicle Charging Dataset
File types: HTML and RMarkDown

### Introduction
This dataset contains Existing public Electric Vehicle (EV) charging stations within Connecticut from US DOE map found at https://afdc.energy.gov/stations/#/find/nearest complemented with research done by DEEP as of 05/27/2020

### Exploratory Data Analysis
I decided to find the days that the electric vehicle charging stations were most frequented during the surveying period. From the histogram shown, separated into different days, what I can tell from this dataset is that the weekend is where these charging stations are used the least.
Thursday is where the charging stations are used the most. The conclusion I can draw is that the electric vehicles arenâ€™t used much on the weekend because of the lack of need to commute to work.

## Summary of Findings 
On average, Sunday is the day where the amount of charge is maximized. 
There must be an inverse relationship between the number of cars charging on the same day and the kwhTotal variable.Given that the number of people charging on the weekends was drastically reduced by several times, I suspect the cause of this phenomenon is that this allowed more charge to be distributed among each car that was still charging on the weekend.
Overall, the findings show that the weekends have fewer people charging while the energy efficiency is maximized
